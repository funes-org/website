title: Funes - Event Sourcing Meta-Framework for Rails

<section class="hero">
  <h1>Event sourcing meta-framework for Rails</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Where history matters as much as the present. Deep conceptual
    compression over complex architectural patterns. Built for the
    "one person framework" philosophy.

  <h2>Three Core Concepts</h2>
  <div class="concepts-grid">
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>Immutable facts of what happened. Historical records that never change, built on ActiveModel with validations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Streams</h3>
      <p>Logical grouping of related events. The primary interface that orchestrates changes and ensures consistency.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>Projections</h3>
      <p>Transform events into readable state. Virtual for validation, persistent for fast reads.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Temporal queries — "what was the balance on December 1st?"</li>
    <li>Multiple read models derived from the same events</li>
    <li>Safe refactoring by rebuilding projections from event log</li>
    <li>Progressive adoption with existing ActiveRecord models</li>
  </ul>
